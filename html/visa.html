        EU/EEA/Swiss citizens do not need a visa when crossing the border to Romania but they are required to present a valid national passport or any document recognized by the Romanian state that certifies their identity.

        A Romanian visa gives the holder the right to enter the territory of the Romanian state. Holding an entry visa does not guarantee entry to Romanian territory. The border checkpoint officers can ask for proof that the general conditions of entry and stay on Romanian territory are met, as provided by law. Should those conditions not be met, foreigners will be denied entry to Romania even if they have a visa. The border checkpoint officers may also reduce the validity
period of the visa if the foreigner does not give sufficient proof of means of support to cover the entire period for which the visa is valid.
