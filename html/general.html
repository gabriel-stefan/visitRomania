    <p id="bani">
        The Romanian leu is the currency of Romania. It is subdivided into 100 bani, a word that means both "money" and "coin" in the Romanian language. The name of the currency means "lion", and is derived from the Dutch thaler. The Dutch leeuwendaalder was imitated in several German and Italian cities. These coins circulated in Romania, Moldova and Bulgaria and gave their name to their respective currencies: the Romanian leu, the Moldovan leu and the Bulgarian lev.

    <p id="language">
        Romanian, a Romance language, is the official language of the country, though technically it is the Daco-Romanian dialect that is spoken by nine-tenths of the populace in several regional variants. Hungarian is the only other language of Romania that is spoken by more than a million people. Smaller numbers speak Romany, German, Turkish, Serbian, and other languages.
